I should be more productive. Don't use that as a reason to **flagellate** and beat yourself up the the end of the day. You can simply choose to be satisfied with how much work you have done today, and that's fine.

Almost we've thrown the baby out with the bathwater and we have given intensity a bad name. Not everything in life is a marathon where you have to pace yourself. Somethings can be sprints. It is totally fine to have a brief period of intensity. Consistency is super important for most things in life but it is worth remembering that small period of intensity punctuated by long period of rest is also a very reasonable way to go about things depending on what you are working on.

You can simply choose to take actions even if you are not motivated to do it. Rather than motivation leading to actions it's more that action leads to motivation. The more you do something and the more small successess you can get under your belt, the more motivated you are going to be to continue doing the thing.

Do you have the audacity to try and make $$ a year from XXX, where you have fun, freedom flexibility? if yes, You do need to hustle really really hard. Hard work is aparently not as bad as it sounds.

Team self-care: Go get some rose petals, go for a walk in nature. Have a nice time.
Team productivity: I want to work
These are not diametrically opposed things. They are actually two sides of same coin. They often go together. Productivity is self-care.
I am not going to hand in my **dissertation** tomorrrow because i deselve self-care. No. Skrew that. The greatest thing you can do for your own self-care s to actually be productive. Don't go far in the direction of separating out productivity and self-care. In some cases, taking a break is exactly you need to do to boost your productivity.

SMART Goals do not tell the whole story. They need to be proximal i.e. close to us in time are better. Intrinsic. Let's understand what is Extrinscial - things outside of your control i.e subject to the winds of the market or the whims of other people. Intrinsical are purely with in your own control and you are more likely to feel a sense of autonomy, control, power and competence as you move towars these particular goals. 
SMART - Specific Measurable Acheivable Realistic and Time-bound
PI - Proximal and Intrinsic
